I am an aerospace engineer who was ready to takeoff in 2020 âœˆ, however, my flight ended up being delayed by a pandemic ðŸ˜·, leaving me at the gate's pre-boarding waiting room. While waiting for something to change, I discovered this amazing world of âœ¨**front-end and webdesign**âœ¨, and after lots of thinking I finally decided to dive into it.

After some online courses, some self-taught concepts and lots of studying ðŸ“š I am now starting a portifolio with the things I have made so far. You can check them out over here!

If you saw something that caught your eye and you would like to give me a feedback, dont excitate to reach out!
